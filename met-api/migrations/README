# Migrations 

Uses alembic, SQL Alchemy, and flask-migrate to perform DB migrations.

To create a new revision:

`alembic revision -m "description of revision"`

## Languages

The list of languages in `supported_languages.json` has been taken from [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) and modified slightly to remove duplicate or multiple language codes per language.

A migration is run to insert these into the database as available languages in the app.
