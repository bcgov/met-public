  - Updated the Metadata Management UI to allow taxa to be marked as filterable.

    - `chips_all`: Similar to chips_any; uses the `list_match_all` subquery to get only engagements with ALL of the selected values.
  - If multiple filterable taxa are selected, all the taxon filters must be met for an engagement to be returned.
  - Updated the public-facing engagement list to allow filtering by metadata taxa. This makes use of the new API endpoint to retrieve filterable taxa.
  - Added a new filter "drawer" to the listing page to hold these and any future filter types.
  - (Out of scope, but related to UX work for this ticket) Fixed a display issue with the public engagements page where engagements would not take up the full width of their grid cell.
